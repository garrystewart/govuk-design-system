The GOV.UK Design System is based on the research and experience of teams across the whole of government.

We use GitHub to discuss and organise work with contributors on existing components and patterns, as well as possible future additions.

See the [Community Backlog project board on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1). It’s organised into columns to show the progress of each contribution and how you can help.

Use the Community Backlog to:

* see what components or patterns are currently being worked on — and how you can help
* see examples of components or patterns that are not in the Design System yet
* share feedback on how components or patterns are performing in your service

For more information on what the Design System team is working on and planning to do, [see our roadmap](/community/roadmap/).
