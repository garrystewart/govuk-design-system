Use the summary list to summarise information, for example, a user’s responses at the end of a form.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the summary list component to present pairs of related information, known as key-value pairs, in a list. The key is a description or label of a piece of information, like ‘Name’, and the value is the piece of information itself, like ‘John Smith’.

You can use it to display metadata like ‘Last updated’ with a date like ‘22 June 2018’, or to summarise a user’s responses at the end of a form like the [check answers](/patterns/check-answers/) pattern.

## When not to use this component

The summary list uses the description list (`<dl>`) HTML element, so only use it to present information that has a key and at least one value.

Do not use it for tabular data or a simple list of information or tasks, like a [task list](/patterns/task-list-pages/). For those use a `<table>`, `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

## How it works

You can show a single or multiple summary lists on a page. To add structure to a page with multiple summary lists, you can use headings or summary cards.

There are 2 ways to use the summary list component. You can use HTML or, if you’re using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "without-actions", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

###  Adding actions to each row

You can add actions to a summary list, like a ‘Change’ link to let users go back and edit their answer.

For sighted users, the actions get their context from the other content in the row they appear in.

Assistive technology users, like those who use a screen reader, may hear the links out of context and not know what they do.

To give more context, add visually hidden text to the links. This means a screen reader user will hear a meaningful action, like ‘Change name’ or ‘Change date of birth’.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, titleSuffix: "second"}) }}

If you have a mix of rows with and without actions, add the `govuk-summary-list__row--no-actions` modifier class to the rows without actions.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "mixed-actions", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Removing the borders

The summary list includes some separating borders to help users read each row and its action.

If your summary list does not have any actions, you can choose to remove the separating borders with the `govuk-summary-list--no-border` class.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "without-borders", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

To remove borders on a single row, use the `govuk-summary-list__row--no-border` class.

## Showing multiple summary lists

If you’re showing multiple summary lists on a page, you can show each list within a summary card. This lets you visually separate them and give each list a title and some actions.

Use summary cards when you need to:
- show multiple summary lists that are related to one another
- show actions that will apply to everything in a summary list

But do not use summary cards if you only need to show a small amount of related information. Use summary lists instead, and structure them with headings if needed.

If you’re showing summary cards at the end of a journey, you might want to familiarise the user with them earlier on — such as when the user reviews individual sections.

### Summary card with a title

Use the summary card’s header to give each summary list a title.

Each title should be unique and help identify what the information in the summary list is meant to describe. For example, this could be a person, organisation or professional qualification.

A title can simply be made up of one or two important values in the summary list — such as the first and last name of a person. Try to keep titles short.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "card-with-title", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Summary card with a title and actions

You can also add action links in the header. These should be actions that apply to all values in the summary list, such as ‘Delete’, ‘Edit’ or ‘Update status’. 

For example, you might choose to show a single ‘Change’ link in the header, instead of repeating change links for every row, if they’d all go to the same page anyway.

Do not add more than 3 actions in a header.

Remember to follow the rest of the guidance in ‘Adding actions to each row’ to help assistive technology users.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "card-with-actions", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Summary card without a title

Summary cards should have a title — but there are some instances when you might choose not to add a title.

For example, you might need to show multiple summary lists and visually separate them — but it does not make sense to write titles and headings.

Similarly, you might need to show a mix of summary lists that do, and do not, call for titles.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "card-no-title", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## Research on this component

This component was developed and tested by the Government Digital Service as part of the [check answers pattern](/patterns/check-answers/).

The Department for Education contributed the summary card. It’s being used on services to:
- apply for teacher training (used by citizens)
- register trainee teachers (used by teacher training providers)

It is also being used by other departments to help users:
- manage supervisions (Ministry of Justice)
- submit social housing lettings and sales data (Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities)

### Next steps

More research is needed to find out how well this component works outside the check answers pattern, for example, to present summaries within caseworking systems.
